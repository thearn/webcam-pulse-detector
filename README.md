webcam-pulse-detector
-----------------------

A python code that detects the heart-rate of an individual using a common webcam or network IP camera. 
Tested on OSX 10.7 (Lion), Ubuntu 13.04 (Ringtail), and Windows 7.

Inspired by reviewing recent work on [Eulerian Video Magnification](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/), 
with motivation to implement something visually comparable (though not necessarily identical in formulation) to their
pulse detection examples using [Python](http://python.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). 
This goal is comparable to those of a few previous efforts in this area 
(such as https://github.com/mossblaser/HeartMonitor).

This code was developed at [NASA Glenn Research Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn) in 
support of [OpenMDAO](http://openmdao.org/), under the Aeronautical Sciences Project in NASA's 
[Fundamental Aeronautics Program](http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/), as well as the Crew State Monitoring Element 
of the Vehicle Systems Safety Technologies Project, in NASAâ€™s 
[Aviation Safety Program](http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs_avsafe.htm).

A list of other open-source NASA codes can be found at [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov/project/).

How it works:
-----------------
This application uses [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to find the location of the user's face, then isolate the forehead region. Data is collected
from this location over time to estimate the user's heart rate. This is done by measuring average optical
intensity in the forehead location, in the subimage's green channel alone (a better color mixing ratio may exist, but the 
blue channel tends to be very noisy). Physiological data can be estimated this way thanks to the optical absorption 
characteristics of (oxy-) haemoglobin (see http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-26-21434). 

With good lighting and minimal noise due to motion, a stable heartbeat should be 
isolated in about 15 seconds. Other physiological waveforms (such as 
[Mayer waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer_waves)) should also be visible in the raw data stream.

Once the user's hear rate has been estimated, real-time phase variation associated with this 
frequency is also computed. This allows for the heartbeat to be exaggerated in the post-process frame rendering, 
causing the highlighted forehead location to pulse in sync with the user's own heartbeat.

Support for detection on multiple simultaneous individuals in a single camera's 
image stream is definitely possible, but at the moment only the information from one face 
is extracted for analysis.

The overall dataflow/execution order for the real-time signal processing looks like:

This signal processing design is implemented in the openMDAO assembly object defined in
[lib/processors.py](lib/processors.py).

The definition of each component block used can be found in the source 
files [lib/imageProcess.py](lib/imageProcess.py), [lib/signalProcess.py](lib/signalProcess.py), and 
[lib/sliceops.py](lib/sliceops.py). The `@bin` and `@bout` blocks in the above graph denote assembly-level input and 
output.


Requirements:
---------------

- [Python v2.7+](http://python.org/)
- [OpenCV v2.4+](http://opencv.org/), with the cv2 python bindings
 
OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision library, with a convenient 
numpy-compatible interface in the cv2 bindings.

- [OpenMDAO v0.5.5+](http://openmdao.org/)

OpenMDAO is an open-source engineering framework that serves as a convenient 
environment to containerize the required real-time analysis, and 
allow for that analysis to be easily tweaked to specification and compared with alternative designs. 
Upon installation, OpenMDAO is bootstrapped into its own Python 
virtualenv, which must be activated before use (see the Quickstart section below). OpenMDAO requires python 2.6+, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib 
(see http://openmdao.org/docs/getting-started/requirements.html)

Quickstart:
------------
- Activate the openMDAO virtual python environment in a command or terminal window. On Linux and OSX, this is done by
running:

```
. OpenMDAO/bin/activate
```
Or on Windows:

```
OpenMDAO\Scripts\activate
```

- In the activated environment, navigate to the downloaded source directory, and run get_pulse.py to start the application

```
python get_pulse.py
```

- To run on an IP camera, set the `url`, `user`, and `password` strings on line 134 of `get_pulse_ipcam.py`, then run:

```
python get_pulse_ipcam.py
```
This was tested on a Wowwee Rovio.

- If there is an error, try running `test_webcam.py` in the same directory to check if your openCV installation and webcam can be made to work
with this application.

Usage notes:
----------
- When run, a window will open showing a stream from your computer's webcam
- When a forehead location has been isolated, the user should press "S" on their 
keyboard to lock this location, and remain as still as possible (the camera 
stream window must have focus for the click to register). This freezes the acquisition location in place. This lock can
be released by pressing "S" again.
- To view a stream of the measured data as it is gathered, press "D". To hide this display, press "D" again.
- The data display shows three data traces, from top to bottom: 
   1. raw optical intensity
   2. extracted heartbeat signal
   3. Power spectral density, with local maxima indicating the heartrate (in beats per minute). 
- With consistent lighting and minimal head motion, a stable heartbeat should be 
isolated in about 15 to 20 seconds. A count-down is shown in the image frame.
- If a large spike in optical intensity is measured in the data (due to motion 
noise, sudden change in lighting, etc) the data collection process is reset and 
started over. The sensitivity of this feature can be tweaked by changing `data_spike_limit` on line 31 of [get_pulse.py](get_pulse.py).
Other mutable parameters of the analysis can be changed here as well.

TODO:
------
- There have been some requests for a video demo
- Instead of processing using the green channel alone, it is likely that some fixed combination of the statistics of the
R,G,B channels could instead be optimal (though I was unable to find a simple combination that was better than green
alone). If so, the mixing ratios might be determinable from the forward projection matrices of PCA or ICA operators 
computed on a set of mean value R,G, and B data gathered over a trial data set (and verified with different individuals 
under different lighting conditions).
- Support for multiple individuals
- Smoother tracking of data from foreheads, perhaps by buffering and registering/inverse-transforming image subframes
